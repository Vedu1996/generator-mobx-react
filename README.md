## Introduction

`mobx-react` is a fantastic library that combines [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) observables with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for powerful, intuitive state management.

This generator is intended to help people get started with `mobx-react` by providing a relatively lightweight project generator that takes care of the basic project infrastructure and lets the user get started coding right away.

## What `yo mobx-react` handles for you

This generator will set up a basic React/MobX project for you, including the following features:

  - Scaffold a basic app, including config files and dependencies
  - Choice between ES2015 and TypeScript
  - If using ES2015, `yo mobx-react` will set up Babel 6 + the appropriate plugins and presets for supporting React + Mobx
    - [babel-preset-es2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/)
    - [babel-preset-stage-1](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1/) (for spread/rest and extended class syntax)
    - [babel-preset-react](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/)
    - [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) (since Babel 6 doesn't currently support decorators, we need this to work with `mobx`)
    - [babel-plugin-transform-object-assign](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-assign/)
    - [babel-plugin-array-includes](https://github.com/stoeffel/babel-plugin-array-includes)
  - If using TypeScript, `yo mobx-react` will install the latest version of TypeScript, plus [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) for type definitions. It will also set up a basic `tsconfig` and `typings.json` file for you, with `React` and `React-DOM` typings installed.

- Webpack, with the following configuration
    - transpilation via `babel-loader` or `awesome-typescript-loader`
    - css bundling
    - npm-auto-install
    - code splitting in production builds
    - webpack-dev-server with hot module reloading
- eslint
    - `babel-eslint` parser so the linter doesn't freak out about decorators (or other features)
    - uses the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
    - configurable via `.eslintrc.js`
- `package.json` with the necessary dependencies, as well as scripts for the dev server as well as production build

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-mobx-react using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-mobx-react
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo mobx-react
```

## npm Scripts

Once you've generated your project, you'll have access to the following npm scripts from the command line:

- `npm run build`: Transpile and bundle your project via `webpack` using `production` optimizations.
- `npm start`: Start `webpack-dev-server` at `http://localhost:8080`. `webpack-dev-server` will automatically rebuild your app whenever you save changes. In addition, it will hot-reload your changes without triggering a browser refresh (i.e. your state persists across file changes!!). Finally, it will automatically install any unresolved dependencies whenever you `import` them in your code.
- `npm run build-es6`: Transpile your code to `ES2015` modules. Note that this option *does not* bundle or optimize your code. Instead, it simply transpiles each module in your `src` directory into a corresponding `ES2015` module in the `es6` directory. This gives you the option to then use a tree-shaking bundler like [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org).
- `npm run clean`: `rimraf` all the things (except `src` obviously)
- `npm run compile`: Build all the things. This command will run all of the preceding build steps in sequence.

## TO DO

- Create new folder if the current working directory doesn't match the project name

## Acknowledgements
- @mweststrate and the [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) team
- [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/) for being an unbelievably useful resource for figuring out Webpack config stuff. Almost all of the webpack tricks implemented in `yo mobx-react` are based on things I learned from SurviveJS. Definitely buy the book!
